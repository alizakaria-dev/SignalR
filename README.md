Trying to learn about realtime applications, I developed this reservation app using signalR, hangfire and angular. You can see in the video that there are two users and when one of them makes a change, it is reflected on the other user's screen. Also I added hangfire to create a background job to implement a logic that when a button is clicked, within 5 seconds all the unreserved seats will be converted to reserved
