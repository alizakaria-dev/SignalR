In an attempt to learn about real-time applications, I developed this real-time reservation app using .NET Core SignalR in the backend and Angular in the frontend. In the video (SignalR.mp4), you can see two users opening the application, and when one user makes a change, it is reflected on the other user's screen. Additionally, I used Hangfire to create a background job. When this job is triggered, after 5 seconds, all the seats which are not reserved will change status to reserved.
